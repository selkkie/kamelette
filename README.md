# Kamelette

Kamelette is a tool for quickly testing out random color palettes on an image. It's powered by [Colormind](https://github.com/dmi3kno/colormind).

## Modification
If you want to modify, you'll need [browserify](https://github.com/browserify/browserify) to compile a new bundle.js file. Make changes in kamelette.js, then run `browserify kamelette.js -o bundle.js`
